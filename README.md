## hello_world
I wrote this as a flutter application so if you are new to it, I attached some resources for a beginner project. The main readme for the app is in the app folder. Enjoy!

## Getting Started
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- Lab: [Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- Cookbook: [Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/learning-resources)

For help getting started with Flutter, view this online documentation, which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
